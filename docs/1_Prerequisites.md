While you are waiting for class to begin, please take a few minutes to set up your local work environment.

## Step 1: Install Git

Git is an open source version control application. You will need Git installed for this class.

You may already have Git installed so let's check! Open Terminal if you are on a Mac, or PowerShell if you are on a Windows machine, and type:

```sh
git --version
```

You should see something like this:

```shell-session
$ git --version
git version 2.11.0
```

If you are using **Windows**, you can download **git-scm** from [this git-scm download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Once you installed git-cli, you can follow following steps:
1. Click bottom left Windows button
2. Type to search **git cli**
3. Select Git CLI
4. Now, you can use this CLI window to perform pretty much all basic Linux/UNIX commands like `ls`, `mkdir`, or run shell scripts

We suggest having version [2.29.2](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.29.2.windows.2) or more recent if you're using Git for Windows or Git Bash.

### Downloading and Installing Git

If you don't already have Git installed, you can download Git at [**www.git-scm.com**](https://www.git-scm.com).

If you need additional assistance installing Git, you can find more information in [the ProGit chapter on installing Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Where is Your Shell?

Now is a good time to create a shortcut to the command line application you will want to use with Git:

- If you are working on Windows, we recommend `Git Bash` which is installed with the Git package, so that you can follow along with the facilitator who will be using Bash.
- If you are working on macOS or another Unix-like system, you can use the built-in Terminal application.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Text Editor

For this class, we will use a basic text editor to interact with our code. Let's make sure you have one installed and ready to work from the command line.

### Pick Your Editor

You can use almost any text editor, but we have the best success with the following:

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Notepad
- Vi or Vim
- Sublime
- Notepad++
- GitPad

If you do not already have a text editor installed, go ahead and download and install one of the above editors now!

## Congratulation. You are done with "Prerequisite" section
